CP PRACTICES for being sonic---
1)this is what every cp code should begin with-
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
// solution comes here
}

2)use "\n" instead of endl it saves time 

3)modulo 10^9 +  7 this shit to control int out of range stuff
for example we calculate factorial of a number-
    long long x = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    x = (x*i)%m;
   }
    cout << x%m << "\n";

4)typedef long long ll;
typedef makes u write long stuff into smaller stuff to save time.

long long x = 1; is bit long to write but ll x=1; is not.
